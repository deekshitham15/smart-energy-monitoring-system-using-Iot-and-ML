This project presents an IoT-enabled Smart Energy Monitoring System designed to track and analyze household or industrial electricity consumption in real time. The system measures voltage, current, power, and cumulative energy usage using ESP32, voltage sensors, and current sensors, transmitting data to a cloud backend for processing. A responsive web dashboard visualizes live sensor readings, historical trends, and estimated billing details.

Machine Learning (ML) models such as Decision Tree and Support Vector Machine are implemented to classify consumption patterns and predict future energy costs. Users receive instant alerts on over-consumption, threshold exceedance, or abnormal usage via mobile notifications. The solution aims to promote energy efficiency, reduce electricity wastage, and support data-driven decision-making for smarter energy management.
